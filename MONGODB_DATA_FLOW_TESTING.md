2. **Fill Complete Nomination Form**
   - Navigate to "Submit Application"
   - Fill all 6 sections:
     * Basic Information
     * Contact Information  
     * WUA Details
     * Project Information
     * Banking Information
     * Supporting Documents
   - Click "Submit Nomination"
   - ‚úÖ **Expected Result**: "Nomination submitted successfully! Your WUA ID: WUA/MH/2024/xxx"

3. **Verify MongoDB Storage**
   - Go to "Data Flow Test" from dashboard
   - Click "Refresh Data"
   - ‚úÖ **Expected Result**: Your nomination appears with status "submitted"

### Phase 2: Self-Assessment (Optional)
1. **Complete Self-Assessment**
   - Go to "Self-Assessment Questionnaire"
   - Fill 5 modules with scoring
   - Submit assessment
   - ‚úÖ **Expected Result**: Status updates to "self-assessment-completed"

### Phase 3: Circle Committee Evaluation
1. **Login as Circle Committee**
   - Use admin credentials with circle committee access
   - Navigate to "Circle Committee Evaluation"

2. **Access Nomination Data**
   - Form automatically loads pending nominations from MongoDB
   - Select your submitted WUA for evaluation
   - ‚úÖ **Expected Result**: All nomination data pre-filled from database

3. **Complete Evaluation**
   - Fill 5-step evaluation process
   - Submit with score/recommendation
   - ‚úÖ **Expected Result**: Status updates to "circle-evaluation-completed"

### Phase 4: Corporation Committee Assessment
1. **Login as Corporation Committee**
   - Use appropriate credentials
   - Navigate to "Corporation Committee Assessment"

2. **Review Circle-Approved Nominations**
   - System shows only nominations with "circle-evaluation-completed"
   - Access detailed nomination + circle evaluation data
   - ‚úÖ **Expected Result**: Previous evaluation scores visible

### Phase 5: State Committee Final Decision
1. **Login as State Committee**
   - Use state committee credentials
   - Navigate to "State Committee Evaluation"

2. **Final Award Decision**
   - Review complete evaluation journey
   - Make final award determination
   - ‚úÖ **Expected Result**: Final status with award category

## üîç Real-Time Monitoring

### Data Flow Test Dashboard
- Location: `/admin/data-flow-test`
- Shows live MongoDB data
- Real-time status updates
- Evaluation journey tracking

### Key API Endpoints
```javascript
POST /api/nominations/submit         // Store new nomination
GET  /api/nominations/get-for-evaluation?stage=circle    // Get pending evaluations
GET  /api/nominations/get-for-evaluation?stage=all       // Get all nominations
POST /api/evaluations/circle/submit  // Store circle evaluation
```

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Database Integration
- [ ] Nomination form saves to MongoDB
- [ ] Committee forms load data from MongoDB  
- [ ] Status updates persist across sessions
- [ ] Evaluation scores stored and retrieved
- [ ] Complete audit trail maintained

### Cross-Form Data Access
- [ ] Circle Committee sees submitted nominations
- [ ] Corporation Committee sees circle-approved items
- [ ] State Committee sees corporation-approved items
- [ ] All previous evaluation data accessible

### Real-World Scenarios
- [ ] Multiple WUAs can be submitted
- [ ] Different districts work independently  
- [ ] Committee members see only relevant nominations
- [ ] Status progression follows correct workflow
- [ ] Data integrity maintained throughout

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Authentication required"**
   - Check localStorage for valid tokens
   - Re-login if session expired

2. **"No nominations found"**
   - Ensure nominations were submitted successfully
   - Check Data Flow Test page for actual database content

3. **"Failed to load nominations"**
   - Check network connection
   - Verify MongoDB connection in server logs

4. **Form not pre-filling data**
   - Check API response in browser DevTools
   - Verify nomination exists in correct status

### Debug Steps
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Check Console for error messages
3. Monitor Network tab for API calls
4. Verify localStorage tokens are valid
5. Check Data Flow Test page for actual data

## üìä Expected Results Summary

After complete testing, you should see:
- **1 nomination** in "state-evaluation-completed" status
- **Complete evaluation journey** with all scores
- **Cross-form data access** working seamlessly
- **Real-time status updates** in Data Flow Test
- **Audit trail** of all evaluation steps

## üéØ Production Readiness
